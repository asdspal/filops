## Overview

**FilOps** is an autonomous agent suite designed to automate and optimize every aspect of Filecoin storage operations. Leveraging a modular architecture, FilOps provides intelligent agents for replica balancing, predictive deal renewal, and pricing arbitrageâ€”enabling fully self-healing, policy-driven data pipeline automation on Filecoin.

---

## Features

- **Replica Balance Agent:** Maintains geo-distributed replicas by automatically creating deals and upgrading sectors to meet resilience policies.
- **Predictive Renewal Agent:** Uses AI/ML forecasting to proactively top-up collateral and renew deals before expiration, ensuring uninterrupted storage.
- **Pricing Arbitrage Agent:** Continuously scans provider pricing and SLA metrics to migrate cold data cost-effectively while maintaining SLA guarantees.
- **Policy-Driven Automation:** Define custom policies for geo-replication, renewal thresholds, and cost limits through an intuitive dashboard.
- **Unified API & CLI:** Manage agents, policies, and storage workflows seamlessly via REST APIs and command-line tools.
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts:** Track agent health, SLA statuses, and cost optimizations with customizable alerting.

---

## Architecture

FilOps is a microservices-based system including:
- Agent services (node.js/TypeScript) deployed serverlessly or in Kubernetes
- Event-driven Kafka bus for real-time PDP proof and pricing data
- AI/ML microservice for forecasting and decision-making
- PostgreSQL and time-series databases for metadata and metrics
- Frontend dashboard built with React and Next.js
- Deep integration with Filecoin Onchain Cloud using Synapse SDK

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x
- Docker and Kubernetes (optional for local orchestration)
- Access to a Filecoin testnet or mainnet node
- Wallet with FIL tokens for testing payments and deals

### Installation

```

git clone https://github.com/your-org/filops.git
cd filops
npm install

```

### Configuration

Configure `.env` with:
- Filecoin node RPC endpoint
- Wallet private key or KMS credentials
- Kafka broker connection details
- AI model parameters

### Running Locally

```

npm run start:agents
npm run start:dashboard

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the dashboard.

---

## Usage

- Use the onboarding wizard to link Git repos and wallets.
- Create and customize policies for geo-replication and renewal thresholds.
- Monitor agent activity and storage SLA adherence in real time.
- Use CLI commands to manually control agents or trigger workflows.
